    <b>Web3</b> (also known as <b><i>Web 3.0</i></b>) is an idea for a new iteration of the <b><u>World Wide Web</u></b> which incorporates concepts such as decentralization, <b>blockchain technologies, and token-based economics</b>. This is distinct from Tim Berners-Lee's concept of the Semantic Web. Some technologists and journalists have contrasted it with Web 2.0, in which they say user-generated content is controlled by a small group of companies referred to as Big Tech.The term "web3" was coined in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, and the idea gained interest in 2021 from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, large technology companies, and venture capital firms. The concepts of web3 were first represented in 2013.
<br><br>
Critics have expressed concerns over the centralization of wealth to a small group of investors and individuals,or a loss of privacy due to more expansive data collection.Billionaires like <b><u>Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey</u></b> have argued that web3 only serves as a buzzword or marketing term.
