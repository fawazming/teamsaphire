Academic researchers, such as <b><u>Tomer J. Chaffer and Justin Goldston</u></b> in 2022, have described web3 as a possible solution to concerns about the over-centralization of the web in a few <b>"Big Tech"</b> companies.Some have expressed the notion that web3 could improve data security, scalability, and privacy beyond what is currently possible with Web 2.0 platforms.<b><u>Bloomberg</u></b> states that skeptics say the idea "is a long way from proving its use beyond niche applications, many of them tools aimed at crypto traders" <b>The New York</b> Times reported that several investors are betting <b><u>$27 billion</u></b> that web3 "is the future of the internet".
<br>
<p>Some Web 2.0 companies, including <b><u>Reddit and Discord</u></b>, have explored incorporating web3 technologies into their platforms. On November 8, 2021,<b>CEO Jason Citron</b> tweeted a screenshot suggesting Discord might be exploring integrating cryptocurrency wallets into their platform. Two days later, and after heavy user backlash,Discord announced they had no plans to integrate such technologies and that it was an internal-only concept that had been developed in a company-wide hackathon.</p>
