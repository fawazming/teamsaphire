   <center><h1><b><div class="box-1">Concept Of Web3</b></h1></center> </div>
Specific visions for <b>web3</b> differ, and the term has been described by <b><u>Olga Kharif</u></b> as <b>"hazy"</b>, but they revolve around the idea of decentralization and often incorporate blockchain technologies, such as various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens <i>(NFTs)</i>.<b>Kharif</b> has described web3 as an idea that "would build financial assets, in the form of tokens, into the inner workings of almost anything you do online".A policy brief published by the <b>Bennett Institute</b> for Public Policy at the <u><b>University of Cambridge</b></u>  defined web3 as <b>"the putative next generation of the web's technical, legal, and payments infrastructureâ€”including blockchain, smart contracts and cryptocurrencies</b> ."According to <b>Liu, Zhuotao, et al.</b> (2021), three fundamental architectural enablers of web3 were identified as a combination of decentralized or federated platforms, secured interoperability, and verifiable computing through distributed ledger technologies.

Some visions are based around the concept of decentralized autonomous organizations <i>(DAOs).</i>Decentralized finance <i>(DeFi)</i> is another key concept; in it, users exchange currency without bank or government involvement.Self-sovereign identity allows users to identify themselves without relying on an authentication system such as OAuth, in which a trusted party has to be reached in order to assess identity.
