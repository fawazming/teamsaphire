    <li>My educational journey started at <em><b>Allah Akbar International School</b></em> at Ajegunle, Sagamu. I did my Nursery and finished my Primary school there. <p>
        I gained admission into <em><b>Bade Unik Secondary School</b></em> after passing the entrance examination. I chose to be in <em>science class</em> at the secondary level as I wanted to study a science related course in the tertiary institution. I did both WAEC and NECO there. I wrote JAMB in order to gain admission into a <b>University</b>. <p>I was then offered an admission at the <em><b>Osun State University </b></em>to study <b><i>Data Science</i></b> so as to become a  <b>Data Analyst</b>. I’m currently in my first year there and I’ve been enjoying the learning atmosphere there.</p>
