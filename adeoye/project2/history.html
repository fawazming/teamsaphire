    <center><h1>History of LLMs</h1></center>
    <p>The history of <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b> is a story of rapid progress and innovation in the field of <em>natural language processing (NLP)</em> . The development of LLMs has been a long journey, spanning several decades. In this overview, we will explore the key milestones and advancements that have led to the creation of modern LLMs.
    </p>
    <h1> Early Beginnings (1960s-1980s)
    </h1>
    <p>The first NLP systems were <b>rule-based</b> relying on hand-crafted rules to process language. These systems were limited in their capabilities and were often  <b>brittle</b>, meaning they could only handle a narrow range of inputs.

    </p>
    <h1>Rise of Machine Learning (1990s-2000s)</h1>
    <p>The 1990s and 2000s saw the rise of <b>machine learning</b> in NLP. Machine learning techniques like  <em>decision trees,Support Vector Machines (SVMs)</em>, and <em>neural networks</em>  started to gain traction in NLP.
    </p>
    <h1>Deep Learning Revolution (2010s)
    </h1>
    <p>The 2010s saw a <b>deep learning revolution</b> in NLP. Deep learning techniques like <em>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) </em>and <em>Transformers</em> revolutionized NLP
    </p>
    <h1>Large Language Models (2020s)
    </h1>
    <p>In the 2020s, LLMs have become a major area of research in NLP. LLMs are <b>transformer-based models</b> that have achieved  <em>state-of-the-art</em> results in many NLP tasks.
