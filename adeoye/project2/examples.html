    <h1>Examples of LLMs:</h1>
    <h3>This are some of the examples of large language mode</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)</b>: A popular family of models developed by OpenAI, known for its text generation capabilities. </li>
        <li><b>PaLM (Pathways Language Model)</b>: A transformer language model developed by Google, capable of various tasks like common-sense reasoning and code generation. </li>
        <li><b>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)</b>: Another transformer-based model developed by Google, used for understanding and answering questions. </li>
        <li><b>Llama</b>: Meta AI's </li>
    </ol><br>
    <h1>Application of LLMs</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Education</b>: LLMs can be used to create personalized learning experiences and educational tools.</li>
        <li><b>Research</b>: They can help researchers analyze large amounts of text data and identify patterns and insights. </li>
        <li><b>Training Research</b>: They can help researchers analyze large amounts of text data and identify patterns and insights. LLMs are trained using a process called <em>self-supervised learning</em>, where they learn from vast amounts of unlabeled text data. </li>
        <li><b>Cybersecurity</b>: LLMs can be used to detect and prevent cyber threats.</li>
        <li><b>Customer service</b>: They can power chatbots that provide 24/7 customer support. </li>
        <li><b>Content creation</b>: LLMs can assist in writing articles, blog posts, marketing materials, and other types of content. </li>
