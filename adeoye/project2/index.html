    <p>
        <strong>LLM</strong> stands for <em><b>Large Language Model</b></em> , which refers to a type of artificial intelligence model designed to <u>understand and generate human language</u>. These models are typically based on deep <em>learning architectures</em>, particularly <em>transformer networks</em>, and are trained on vast amounts of text data to <em>learn patterns, grammar, facts, and even some reasoning abilities.</em>A  <b>large language model</b> is a type of <em>machine learning model</em> designed for <em>natural language processing</em> tasks such as <u>language generation</u> . <strong>LLMs</strong> are language models with many parameters, and are trained with <em>self-supervised learning</em> on a vast amount of text. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The largest and most capable LLMs are <strong>generative pretrained transformers</strong> (GPTs). Modern models can be <i>fine-tuned </i>for specific tasks or guided by <i><u>prompt engineering</u></i>. These models acquire predictive power regarding <i>syntax, semantics</i>, and <em>ontologies</em> inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies and biases present in the data they are trained in. <br><br>

        How they work:
    </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>LLMs learn to predict the next word in a sequence based on the context provided, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. </li>
        <li>They use deep learning algorithms, particularly transformer architectures, to analyze and generate text. </li>
        <li>They are trained on vast datasets of text, allowing them to learn patterns and relationships within language. </li>
    </ul>
