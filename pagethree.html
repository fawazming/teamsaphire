<p><b>Web3</b> is distinct from Tim <i><b>Berners-Lee's 1999</b></i> concept of a <i>Semantic Web</i>, which was also sometimes referred to as <b>Web 3.0</b>. While the <i>Semantic Web</i> envisioned a web of linked data,<b>web3</b>  in the blockchain context refers to a decentralized internet built upon distributed ledger technologies.Some writers referring to the decentralized concept usually known as "web3" have used the term <b><i>"Web 3.0"</i></b> , leading to some confusion between the two concepts.Furthermore, some visions of <b>web3</b> also incorporate ideas relating to the semantic web.
</p>

<p>The term <b>"web3"</b> was coined by <b>Polkadot founder and Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood</b> in 2014, referring to a "decentralized online ecosystem based on <b>blockchain</b>."In 2021, the idea of <b>web3</b> gained popularity.Particular interest spiked toward the end of 2021, largely due to interest from cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investments from high-profile technologists and companies.Executives from venture capital firm <b>Andreessen Horowitz</b> traveled to <b><u>Washington, DC, in October 2021</u></b> to lobby for the idea as a potential solution to questions about regulation of the web, with which policymakers have been grappling.</p>
